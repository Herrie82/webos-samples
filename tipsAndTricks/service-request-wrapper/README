ServiceRequestWrapper:
A simple class that provides common service Mojo.Service.Request lifetime management logic,
primarily this prevents garbage collection of request objects and their associated callbacks.

Install:
- Move service-request-wrapper.js into application directory.
- Include service-request-wrapper.js via sources.json

Usage:
- Call ServiceRequestWrapper.request in place of all new Mojo.Service.Request calls.

Note that this wrapper will cleanup non-subscription requests. If a requests is made
as a subscription, the caller must explicitly call the cancel object for the given
request or the request object will remain in the heap until the application closes.
